Project Overview

ECOVISION is a deep learning project designed to detect the current season using a plant or tree image along with environmental parameters. The model combines image-based features extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with numerical environmental data to improve the accuracy of seasonal classification.

Environmental features include temperature, humidity, precipitation, pressure, wind speed, cloud visibility, soil moisture, and solar radiation.
Features

CNN-based image feature extraction

Multimodal fusion of image and environmental data

Season classification with confidence score

Web/API support for uploading images and entering environmental parameters

Dataset

The dataset contains plant/tree images captured across different seasons along with environmental parameters collected from weather sources and sensors.

Results

Multimodal fusion improves accuracy compared to image-only models

Performs consistently across various plant species and lighting conditions


Future Work

Deployment as a full Web Application
