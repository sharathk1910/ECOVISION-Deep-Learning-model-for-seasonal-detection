# ECOVISION-Deep-Learning-model-for-seasonal-detection
About Proposed System (Ecovision) Deep learning-based model using both image + environmental parameters. CNN extracts plant phenological features (leaf color, drying, flowering). Neural network processes temperature, humidity, wind, and other parameters. Fusion of both data streams for improved seasonal prediction.
